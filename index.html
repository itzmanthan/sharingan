   <h2>About This Broken Hero</h2>
   <img class="middle-row" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRMR1kodntyBATQ1JGO5DihOafPmECvIi6nw&usqp=CAU" alt="uchia itachi">
   <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later <br>
      became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined  <br>
      the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja <br>
       — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more <br>
        complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal <br>
         shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end. But he was he most sacrificing person in this world.Because of him the tsukanome plan was delayed <br>
        for 3 years. And he even serve his village after his death.</p>

<h2>Abilites of this GOD</h2>

<p>Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent, he consistently showed prowess well-beyond his years, <br>
   effortlessly learning new jutsu from simple observation, and rising rapidly through the ninja ranks. His prowess rivalled Shisui Uchiha, who <br>
    was well-regarded as the strongest Uchiha of their time. He was highly proficient in all three main ninja skill sets and gained praise from  <br>
    allies and foes alike; Orochimaru, one of the Sannin, openly admitted Itachi was stronger than he was.Obito revealed that despite being <br>
     weakened from illness and Sasuke having absorbed Orochimaru's power, Itachi could have killed Sasuke during their battle if he wanted to. <br>
      Even when restraining himself, a team of jōnin were still pushed to their limits against Itachi.</p>

      <h2>Personality</h2>

      <p>From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable maturity for his age and knowledge on how to deal with every situation. <br>
         For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a rather humble man. Never arrogant about his own abilities nor underestimating <br>
          others, most things he said would be unbiased and accurate. If an opponent exceeded his expectations or posed a legitimate challenge to him  <br>
          or his allies, Itachi would freely admit it. As a seven-year-old, his reasoning was on par with a Hokage. Having studied history, not  <br>
          just of his clan or his village but of the world, he gained a broader appreciation of what was important. Learning so much enabled him to <br>
           understand how events of the past came to happen and, when he applied that same understanding into the future, he became concerned for where <br>
            things were going. At the same time, Itachi was still fairly naïve as a child in many real-world scenarios and as such was willing to <br>
             learn from his peers on how to differentiate situations.[38] He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting directly  <br>
             involved so that he could fully understand them.</p>
